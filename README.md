### Glad to see you here! 🤩

Nice to meet you, as I said before my name is Eric and I am Brazilian. 🇧🇷

I started to program in 2014 after ending my high school when I started my Bachelor's in Computer Engineer 🖥. At my first university years I focused on the course but also worked as a programming tutor at the university 📚, I started to study Object-Oriented Programming and Android development on my third period, the academic year at Brazil is split into 2 periods.

In my sixth period of the university, I dropped out and started to work on Android development 👨🏻‍💻. I went work on a construtech startup 🏗, at the beginning I was unfamiliar with some agile patterns and programming architecture as a lack of knowledge from university but in some months I was refactoring the project and made some others project from the scratch at this company, and after 8 months I became the responsible for the Android area 😃.

What does "be responsible for the area" mean? It means that I had to coordinate the team as work as an architect to new projects and help the other team members on their development, some of my roles were to found new patterns and improvements at the Android community to apply them on our projects.

At this point, I met the [42](https://www.42.fr/) 👽 and found out that it was planning to open doors at Brazil, at São Paulo to be more specific, and resolved to see what it was for. I met the "école" 🇫🇷 and was amazed, after a recruiting Bootcamp, known as "pool"🏊🏼‍♂️, I was approved and started to plan my city change 🔁. I forgot to mention but I'm from Maceió the principal city of Alagoas in Brazil's northeast🏖.

I sent my curriculum to some companies but in my first interview, I was invited to join one of the best Brazilians tech companies ⭐️. When I joined [Ci&T](https://br.ciandt.com/) I started to notice the path that I made until that moment and I started to have some knowledge about what was my real programming level, at least on Android development 💡.

On Ci&T I worked just 5 months on a project of the company that leads the electronic payments segment in Latin America and improved a lot my skills on development as a team, we improved a lot the app that we were working on and created a real team in so little time that was amazing 👨‍👧‍👦.

In June 2020 I was invited to an interview on [Ítau](https://www.itau.com.br/) 🏦, which is one of the world´s largest financial conglomerates 🌎, and was approved on the hiring process.

At this point in the middle of the pandemic that all the world was suffering I had to make a choice between that such team that we made at Ci&T and start at a new team and project on Ítau.

So now I am an Android developer at ítau Unibanco, and I am working on the fraud prevention area so I am very eager with the challenges that I will face soon. I will update this "read.me" soon because I wrote a lot, but I will write something like that on the medium and could put the link here.
